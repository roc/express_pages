<section><h3 id="router.use">router.use([path], function)</h3><p>Use the given middleware <code>function</code>, with optional mount <code>path</code>,
defaulting to "/".
</p><p>Middleware is like a plumbing pipe, requests start at the first middleware you define and work their way "down" the middleware stack processing for each path they match.
</p><pre class="js"><code>var express = require('express');
var app = express();
var router = express.Router();

// simple logger for this router's requests
// all requests to this router will first hit this middleware
router.use(function(req, res, next) {
  console.log('%s %s %s', req.method, req.url, req.path);
  next();
});

// this will only be invoked if the path ends in /bar
router.use('/bar', function(req, res, next) {
  // ... maybe some additional /bar logging ...
  next();
});

// always invoked
router.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

app.use('/foo', router);

app.listen(3000);
</code></pre><p>The "mount" path is stripped and is <strong>not</strong> visible
to the middleware <code>function</code>. The main effect of this feature is that
mounted middleware may operate without code changes regardless of its "prefix"
pathname.
</p><p>The order of which middleware are "defined" using <code>router.use()</code> is
very important, they are invoked sequentially, thus this defines middleware
precedence. For example usually <code>express.logger()</code> is the very
first middleware you would use, logging every request:
</p><pre class="js"><code>router.use(logger());
router.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
router.use(function(req, res){
  res.send('Hello');
});
</code></pre><p>Now suppose you wanted to ignore logging requests for static files, but to
continue logging routes and middleware defined after <code>logger()</code>,
you would simply move <code>static()</code> above:
</p><pre class="js"><code>router.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
router.use(logger());
router.use(function(req, res){
  res.send('Hello');
});
</code></pre><p>Another concrete example would be serving files from multiple directories,
giving precedence to "./public" over the others:
</p><pre class="js"><code>app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/files'));
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/uploads'));</code></pre></section>
