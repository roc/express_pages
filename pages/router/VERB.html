<section><h3 id="router.VERB">router.VERB(path, [callback...], callback)</h3><p>The <code>router.VERB()</code> methods provide the routing functionality
in Express, where <strong>VERB</strong> is one of the HTTP verbs, such
as <code>router.post()</code>. Multiple callbacks may be given, all are treated
equally, and behave just like middleware, with the one exception that
these callbacks may invoke <code>next('route')</code> to bypass the
remaining route callback(s). This mechanism can be used to perform pre-conditions
on a route then pass control to subsequent routes when there is no reason to proceed
with the route matched.
</p><p>The following snippet illustrates the most simple route definition possible. Express
translates the path strings to regular expressions, used internally to match incoming requests.
Query strings are <em>not</em> considered when peforming these matches, for example "GET /"
would match the following route, as would "GET /?name=tobi".
</p><pre class="js"><code>router.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.send('hello world');
});
</code></pre><p>Regular expressions may also be used, and can be useful
if you have very specific restraints, for example the following
would match "GET /commits/71dbb9c" as well as "GET /commits/71dbb9c..4c084f9".
</p><pre class="js"><code>router.get(/^\/commits\/(\w+)(?:\.\.(\w+))?$/, function(req, res){
  var from = req.params[0];
  var to = req.params[1] || 'HEAD';
  res.send('commit range ' + from + '..' + to);
});</code></pre></section>
<h2>Middleware</h2>
<a name="middleware"></a>
<p>As of 4.x, Express no longer depends on Connect. All of Express' previously included middleware are now in separate repos. Please view <a href="https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#middleware">the list of middleware</a>. The only included middleware is now <code>express.static()</code>.</p>
