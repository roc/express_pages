<section><h3 id="req.originalUrl">req.originalUrl</h3><p>This property is much like <code>req.url</code>, however it retains
the original request url, allowing you to rewrite <code>req.url</code>
freely for internal routing purposes. For example the "mounting" feature
of <a href="#app.use">app.use()</a> will rewrite <code>req.url</code> to
strip the mount point.
