<section><h3 id="req.protocol">req.protocol</h3><p>Return the protocol string "http" or "https"
when requested with TLS. When the "trust proxy" 
setting is enabled the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header
field will be trusted. If you're running behind
a reverse proxy that supplies https for you this
may be enabled.
