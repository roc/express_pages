<section><h3 id="req.signedCookies">req.signedCookies</h3><p>When the <code>cookieParser(secret)</code> middleware is used this object
defaults to <code>{}</code>, otherwise contains the signed cookies sent by
the user-agent, unsigned and ready for use. Signed cookies reside in a different
object to show developer intent, otherwise a malicious attack could be
placed on `req.cookie` values which are easy to spoof. Note that signing
a cookie does not mean it is "hidden" nor encrypted, this simply prevents
tampering as the secret used to sign is private.
