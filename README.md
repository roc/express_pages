Made this during an extended lunchbreak to split up the [express documentation megapage](http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html) and to [try and make Tom B happy](https://twitter.com/tombaromba/status/455639421929672705)


Only 'tested' using:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 pages.py
```
